## Pyramid front end
This is the same back end as the main branch, but it has a front end.
The front end was developed by [Charles Chrismann](https://github.com/Charles-Chrismann).

If you're wondering why this isn't on the main branch, it is because they are some front end related bugs.
So using this branch to play is more enjoyable for the eye but less for the brain.
