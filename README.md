# Pyramid
## A website to play a game of card online, using websockets.

Following the popular pyramid drinking card game.<br />
The Master branch contains the original code made in a 10h crunch by myself.<br />

You can play the back version here : https://tha-pyramid.herokuapp.com/ (before November 2022)
